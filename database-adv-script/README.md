## Usage Instructions

### Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure the database schema is created and populated with sample data
2. **File Order**: Start with basic practice files, then move to optimization
3. **Testing**: Run each SQL file and observe the results
4. **Documentation**: Review the corresponding .md files for detailed explanations

### Practice Sequence
1. **Basic Practice**: Start with `subqueries.sql` and `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`
2. **Performance Analysis**: Use `perfomance.sql` with `optimization_report.md`
3. **Indexing**: Apply `database_index.sql` and measure with `index_performance.md`
4. **Advanced Optimization**: Study `partitioning.sql` with `partition_performance.md`
5. **Monitoring**: Implement `performance_monitoring.md` strategies

### Testing Methodology
- Run queries before and after optimizations
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to measure performance
- Document improvements in the respective .md files
- Compare execution times and resource usage

## Key Learning Outcomes

### SQL Skills
- **Subqueries**: Correlated vs. non-correlated subqueries
- **Aggregations**: GROUP BY with various aggregation functions
- **Window Functions**: RANK(), ROW_NUMBER() for data analysis
- **Complex Queries**: Multi-table joins and optimizations

### Performance Skills
- **Query Optimization**: Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
- **Indexing**: Create and optimize database indexes
- **Partitioning**: Implement table partitioning for large datasets
- **Monitoring**: Use SQL tools for performance analysis

### Database Management
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize queries and database structure
- **Monitoring**: Track and analyze database performance
- **Documentation**: Document optimization processes and results
- **Best Practices**: Apply industry-standard optimization techniques

## File Dependencies

- **Schema Required**: All SQL files depend on the database schema from `database-script-0x01/`
- **Sample Data**: Queries assume populated data from `database-script-0x02/`
- **Cross-References**: .md files provide detailed explanations for corresponding .sql files

## Notes

- All queries are designed for PostgreSQL but can be adapted for other databases
- Performance measurements should be conducted on realistic data volumes
- Regular monitoring and maintenance are essential for production environments
- These scripts serve as both learning tools and production-ready optimization examples
